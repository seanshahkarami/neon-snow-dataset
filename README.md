# NEON Snow Segmentation Dataset

This is the start of a small dataset to help develop and validate snow segmentation methods.

We're currently labelling the snow, snow sticks and background objects in the scene. Here's an example:

<img width="640" src="./example.png"/>

The images are labelled using the following colors:

* Background objects: `rgb(255, 0, 0)`
* Snow sticks: `rgb(0, 255, 0)`
* Snow: `rgb(255, 0, 255)`
